# Customer_Churn_Prediction_VJ420
Predicting customer churn is important for a number of reasons in an organization. Here are 5 reasons why it is important:

It helps an organization understand why customers are leaving and identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.
It enables an organization to take proactive measures to prevent churn and retain valuable customers.
It allows an organization to target its retention efforts more effectively, by focusing on customers who are at the highest risk of churning.
It helps an organization reduce the costs associated with acquiring new customers, as retaining existing customers is typically more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
It can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty, as customers who feel valued and appreciated are less likely to churn.

Keeping the importance of predicting churn in an organisation I have developed a Random Forest Classfier which can predict Churn with 90% accuracy.
